# WeatherApp

This application presents a user with a weather dashboard to present a location's weather data.
The application connects to the Openweathermap API and presents weather information given a user's input location.
For example, if the user is to enter the name of a city such as "Tucson", the application will present Tucson's weather data
and a five day forecast on the html document.
The application will add the input location to the selector element as an option.
