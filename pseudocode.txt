A weather dashboard with form inputs

I search for a city
    1. User enters a city in an input, concatenate text with url and api key
    function getAPI(){
    apiURL = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=";
    citySearch = document.querySelector("#city").value;
    apiKey = "&appid=adfd291a73cb793a96b747e8e6006e24";
    apiURL = apiURL + citySearch + apiKey;

    fetch(apiURL)
        .then(function (response){
            return response.json();
        })
        .then(function (data){
            console.log(data);
        });
    };

    var submitCity = document.querySelector("#submit");
    submitCity.addEventListener("click", function(){
    getAPI();
    });
