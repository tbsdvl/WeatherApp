A weather dashboard with form inputs

I search for a city
    1. User enters a city in an input, concatenate text with url and api key
    function getAPI(){
    citySearch = document.querySelector("#someinputID").value
    apiURL = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q="
    apiKey = "adfd291a73cb793a96b747e8e6006e24"
    apiURL = apiURL.concat(citySeach, apiKey);

    fetch(apiURL)
        .then(function (response){
            return response.json();
        })
        .then(function (data){
            console.log(data);
        });
    };

    getAPI();
